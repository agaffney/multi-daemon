======
* add unit testing, probably using unity
* rework so that each daemon is its own binary
 - each daemon has its own test dir
 - top level Makefile has auto <daemon>-test targets that run 'make -C <daemon> test'
 - 'make test' at global level depends on all auto <daemon>-auto targets
* make list/hash get/set functions have an optional extra argument specifying data type
 - default to HASH_TYPE_STRING
 - string type will allocate memory and copy
 - copy type will allocate memory and copy with size specified by an additional function argument
 - nocopy type will just store the pointer
 - useful for maintaining list of callback functions for different phases of the request handling
