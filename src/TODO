common
======
* add unit testing, probably using unity
* rework so that each daemon is its own binary
 - split commandline and config file parsing into reusable library
 - modify Makefiles to create targets for each daemon that just recurse into that dir
 - each daemon has its own test dir
 - top level Makefile has auto <daemon>-test targets that run 'make -C <daemon> test'
 - 'make test' at global level depends on all auto <daemon>-auto targets
